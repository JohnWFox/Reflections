pwd # print working directory - shows what directory you are in
ls  # list the files in this directory

1st Reflect:
  The diff (FC) showed me where things were different between the two files.
I could then go and see where things had changed and it was easier to see where the mistake was made.

2nd Reflections
  Having all version helps by
1) Allowing to see where mistakes were made
2) Keeping stuff that worked and can be reclaimed
3) Allowing to see how programming style changes with time

Manual Commit
Pro 1) Makes sense to you
2) Can be as small or big as you want
3) Allows for other to follow
Con 1) May make commits when too small/big
2) Your logic not others logic

Muti File Commit
If one is working on a project, multi file would be nice if several have changed.
Obviously the down side is all saved even if there was no changes.
Problem with single file save is coordinating saves for the same thing.

git log will tell you what versions of the file you have and any notes attached
git diff will tell you the difference between two versions.

Knowing you can go back to a good version allows you to make mistakes then correct them. This removes the fear of totally destroying the project.
